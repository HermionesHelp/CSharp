              a loaf of bread, and a tin whistle. 

              1. Create a list called "inventory" that contains each of these items
              2. Log the contents of your inventory displaying the items.

             Your inventory can hold 10 items. 
             
            The shop currently has:  
            Loaf of Bread
            Ham Hock
            Long Sword
            Short Bow

            Backpack  <- allows you to carry 10 more items
            Small Silver Key
            
            3. Choose some items to buy and add those items to your inventory. 
                - If you purchase more of an item you already have it will take an additional slot in your inventory.

                - remember it can only hold 10 items so if you buy the backpack you can add items there
                .... which means making a new List. 

            4. Log the contents of your inventory (and backpack if you have one) 
            5. Display a Count of the number of items in your inventory(& backpack).
