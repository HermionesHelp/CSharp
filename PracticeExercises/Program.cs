            We're going on an adventure! But before we can go we have to pack our inventory for the journey. 

             To go on our adventure we have 500 Gold, a flint, a rope, 2 healing potions, a dagger, a bedroll, 
             a loaf of bread, and a tin whistle. 

             1. Create a dictonary called "inventory" that contains each of these items and their values
             2. Log the contents of your inventory displaying the items and how many of each you have.

        /* As your adventure goes on your party reaches a shop. Now is a good time to restock.
         Your inventory can hold 10 items (counted by Key not by Value). 

        The shop currently has an unlimited amount of each item. 
        Loaf of Bread - 2 gold
        Ham Hock - 5 gold
        Long Sword - 100 gold
        Short Bow - 75 gold
        Healing Potion - 25 gold
        Backpack - 75 gold  <- allows you to carry 10 more items
        Small Silver Key - 25 gold

        3. Choose some items to buy, calculate and update the amount of Gold in your Inventory.
        4. Add those items to your inventory. 
            - If you purchase more of an item you already have be sure to update that value instead of adding 
            a new item to your storage. No need to take up a valuable slot.

            - remember it can only hold 10 items so if you buy the backpack you can add items there
            .... which means making a new dictionary. 

        5. Log the contents of your inventory (and backpack if you have one) 
        6. Display a Count of the number of items in your inventory(& backpack).

        Your party mates HATE your tin whistle, lets just say you're not the greatest musician in the world, ok. 
        The shop keeper will buy it from you for 10 gold.

        7. Remove the Tin Whistle from your inventory.
        8. Update your Gold
